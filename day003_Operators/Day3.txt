Operators

is a symbol that performs an operations


+ - * / % etc

int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int result = a+b;

+, =  are operators
a, b are operands

diff type of operator

arithmetic operators    (b) + - * / %
relational/ comparison  (b) > >= <= != ==
logical                 (b) && || !(u)
increment & decrement   (u) ++ --
assignment              (u) = += -+ *= /= %=
conditional / ternary   (t) ?:



arithmetic- can only be performed on numbers

relational- can perform on all data types and always return a boolean value

logical - works with two boolean values and always returns a boolean value

inc&dec - pre increment and post increment, a++ is post, ++a is pre, post increment assign value and then add, pre does the opp
Pre-increment (++variable): Increments the value before the variable is used in an expression.
Post-increment (variable++): Uses the variable's current value in the expression before incrementing it.

assginment 
to shorthandly use arithmetic operations
a=a+5; is same as a+=5


ternary - var=exp ? result1: result2;


eg int x=500, y = 4000;
		int z =(x>y)?x:y;
		System.out.println(z+ " is largest");

if the expression(x>y) is true, the a value is assigned or else b value is assigned


workout - swapping out two numbers
