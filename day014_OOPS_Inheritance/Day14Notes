Inheritance
-----------

>Acquiring all the properties (variables) and behaviour (methods) of one class to another class is inheritance
>We can enable inheritance using the keyword 'extends'

class A
{
  variables
  methods
}

class B extends A
{
  variables of class A and B
  methods of class A and B
}

Here class A is called the parent / base / super class
class B is called child / sub / derived class


Advantage of inheritance
------------------------
>> Reusability
>> Avoid duplication

4 Types on inheritance
    1> single
    2> multi level
    3> hierarchy
    4> multiple  -- cannot be implemented by class, but can be done by interface

why class don't support multiple inheritance?

1> class A extends B , C ==> syntactically wrong
2> If both parents have same method, child will have ambiguity problems - means child don't know which method to acquire
3> Even if there are no methods defined, still its not possible because all classes in Java extends from Object class

>>>In one java file, there will be only one class having public access modifier<<<
