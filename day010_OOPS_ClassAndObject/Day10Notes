Day10 - Class, Object
=====================

what is OOPS language?
	> If any language supports oop concepts, we can call it as oop language

6 oops concepts
    	-class - blueprint of an object
    	-object - an instance of a class
    	-polymorphism
    	-encapsulation
    	-inheritance
    	-data abstraction

Class and Object -> basic / foundation concepts

Class -
	Collection of attribute(variable) and behaviour(methods) (category / group, a virtual entity)
	Class is the blueprint of an object. without class, there is no object
Object -
	Instance of the class
	Acquires all variables and methods

eg - Animal -> dog, cat, horse, etc
eg - student -> name1, name2, name3 etc
	animal is just a name given to a group. the physical entities are dog, cat etc.
	dog cat and horse are objects of animal class
	attributes - height, color, weight etc
	behaviour - way of eating, sleeping, hunting, breeding etc

CLASS
'''''
	1. class is collection of variables and methods
	2. class is a logical entity/ blueprint.
	3. a virtual entity that will not occupy any memory.

class Student
{
	variables
    	methods
}

OBJECT
''''''
	1. object is an instance of a class / object will be created by using a class
	2. a physical entity
	3. will occupy space in a memory
	4. can create multiple objects for a single class

Student studentOne = new Student(); --> constructor
Student studentTwo = new Student();

Note-
	>> whenever we create an object in a class, the object will acquire a copy of the variables and methods from the class
	>> each object in a class is different
	>> the objects should be created inside the main method
	>> there is only one main method for an entire project
